# Welcome to the Kennesaw Autonomous Ground Vehicle Team
----------------------

This repository contains many helpful tutorials on topics and methods used in the software development process over the course of a year on this team. This includes:
* Understanding the benefits of an Integrated Development Environment _(IDE)_, and an introduction to __VS Code__ and its modularity
* Working with __GitHub__ _(Version Control System)_ to allow multiple people to work on the same code base, as well as backup any feature releases
* Working with the __Robot Operating System__ _(ROS)_ To develop multi-computer robots as well as fragment operations
* Utilzing Computer Vision techniques through libraries like __OpenCV__ to manipulate video feeds into usable data for object detection and lane detection
* Understanding the basics of __machine learning__, and implementing basic _neural networks_ through python libary __Keras__
* Condense __LIDAR__ data to be more computationally efficent, and develop basic processing techniques using the __Point Cloud Library__ _(PCL)_
* Simulating sensorimotor feedback through _ROS_ package __Gazebo__ to allow for algorithm testing when access to the physical vehicle is limited
