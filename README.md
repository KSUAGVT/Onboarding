# Welcome to the Kennesaw AGVT Software Team
----------------------
This repository contains many helpful tutorials on topics and methods used in the software development process over the course of a year on this team. This includes:
* Working with __Linux__ and _Bash_
* Understanding the benefits of an Integrated Development Environment _(IDE)_, and an introduction to __VS Code__ and its modularity
* Working with __GitHub__ _(Version Control System)_ to allow multiple people to work on the same code base, as well as backup any feature releases
* Working with the __Robot Operating System__ _(ROS)_ To develop multi-computer robots as well as fragment operations
* Utilzing Computer Vision techniques through libraries like __OpenCV__ to manipulate video feeds into usable data for object detection and lane detection
* Understanding the basics of __machine learning__, and implementing basic _neural networks_ through python libary __Keras__
* Condense __LIDAR__ data to be more computationally efficent, and develop basic processing techniques using the __Point Cloud Library__ _(PCL)_
* Simulating sensorimotor feedback through _ROS_ package __Gazebo__ to allow for algorithm testing when access to the physical vehicle is limited

Each tutorial will be have a folder inside this repository containing all of the files needed to get started. There may be additional readme files inside each folder containing pre-requisite information, such as software development packages required to complete the tutorial. The instructions for each tutorial will be found on their respective wiki-page for this repository. 

It is recommended that you at least attempt each tutorial in order for us to get a sense of where you are software development wise. Feel free to ask officers or experienced members for help on something if you don't understand or can't get something working; sofware development is a collaborative effort, and this team is designed to be a learning experience.
